<h3>The Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration conducts a survey of over 50,000 Americans on their drinking and drug use behavior each year.</h>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>These slides summarize drinking statistics by age group based on results of the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health.</h>

<h2> When Adolescents & Young Adults Drink, They Drink A Lot </h><br></br>

<h3>The percent of Americans who report drinking in the past 30 days increases from about 2% for 12-13 Year Olds to over 90% for 21-25 Year Olds before starting to decline.</h><br></br>

<h3>Among the younger age groups in particular, when they drink, they tend to drink a lot.  For example, a typical 18-20 year old male is drinking an average of 5.3 drinks every time he drinks.</h>

<h2>Binge Drinking is a Major Concern</h><br></br>

<h3>Binge drinking is defined as drinking 5 or more drinks during one drinking occasion.  The percent of the population who are binge drinking is alarmingly high, with over half (53%) of 21-25 year old males reporting binge drinking at least once in the past 30 days.</h><br></br>

<h3>And those who binge at all are binging a lot.  For example, males between 16 and 20 years old who binged at all drank 5 or more drinks two-thirds of the times they drank anything!<h>
